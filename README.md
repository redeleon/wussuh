# Wussuh

"Wussuh" is kind of like a millenial version of "What's up?"

On a serious note, some people don't really like sharing their emotions to anyone, or maybe they do but they are hesitating because maybe they are shy,
this app will be for that person so that they may have an outlet where they can vent out their emotions, whether they're
sad, happy, angry or even if they feel like they can conquer the world!

This project has the basic functions (login, submissions etc.) and built using React.JS
future development will include other features such as:

1. Sharing
2. Mood Tracker
3. Profiles

and some other things that I may think of.

Due to time constraints, Google sheets via Google App Script was used to manage and store data, a "real" database will be used in the future should this project goes out of it's "Demo" status.

Please note that the login here is just a "pseudo-login" which is for demonstration purposes only
It will store the credentials but will only look for the matching email address when logging in.
A better version of login (OAuth) will be used in the future.
