# Wussuh

"Wussuh" is kind of like a millenial version of "What's up?" 

On a serious note, many people doesn't really like sharing their emotions to somebody, this app will
be for that person so thay they may have an outlet where they can vent out their emotions, whether they're
sad, happy, angry or even if they feel like they can conquert the world!

This project has the basic functions (login, submissions etc.) and built using React.JS
future development will include other features such as:

1. Sharing
2. Mood Tracker
3. Profiles

and some other things that I may think of.

Due to time constraints, Google sheets via Google App Script was used to manage and store data, a "real" database will be used in the future should this project goes out of it's "Demo" status.
